## Technical Architecture

### Payment Flow
1. **Order Creation**: User places F&B order
2. **Payment Intent**: Create Stripe payment intent via Convex
3. **Payment Processing**: Handle payment with Stripe Elements
4. **Confirmation**: Confirm payment and update order status
5. **Analytics**: Track payment metrics and update analytics

### Data Flow
```
Frontend (React) → Convex Actions → Stripe API → Webhook → Convex Mutations → Database
```

### Security Model
- All sensitive payment operations handled server-side
- Client-side only handles secure tokenized data
- PCI-compliant payment method storage
- Encrypted payment data transmission

## Requirements Fulfilled

✅ **Requirement 8.4**: "WHEN payment is required THEN the system SHALL process transactions securely through integrated payment system"

- Secure Stripe integration implemented
- PCI-compliant payment processing
- Multiple payment method support
- Real-time transaction processing
- Comprehensive error handling
- Payment analytics and reporting
- Refund and dispute management

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Stripe Account Setup**: Configure production Stripe account
2. **Webhook Endpoints**: Set up production webhook endpoints
3. **Payment Method Validation**: Add additional payment method validation
4. **Fraud Detection**: Implement Stripe Radar for fraud prevention
5. **Compliance**: Ensure PCI DSS compliance for production
6. **Monitoring**: Set up payment processing monitoring and alerts
